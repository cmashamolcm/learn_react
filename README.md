### What is React?
- React is a client side js library

### If its just a js library, why do we need it..why can't we go with just js?
1. When we want to build a dynamic part of html, eg: open a dialog on button click, we have to build entire html equivalent element using js. But that us very tedious and errornious.
2. It will be easier if with limited code, we can generate these components. That is where React library helps. React helps to create a dynamic component with proper skeleton(html), css(skin) and js(actions).
3. Ultimately, React library helps us with a declarative way of developing components. At the end, it gets transpiles to pian js.


### SPA - Single Page Applications
1. Server sends only single html page and rest is ontrolled by React.
2. In multipage apps also, it can be used.

### Angular vs React vs Vue
1. Angular is a framework uses ts(type script)
2. All are componenet based UI
